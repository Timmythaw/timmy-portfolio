# Crazy Turtle!

## This program was inspired from no. 68 of Turtle Exercises. 

I upgraded the program where turtle keep drawing random shapes w/o stopping.
But Included a feature to control it ofc. The Algorithm is nearly versatile enough
to draw irregular and someitmes even regular shapes that we wouldn't have 
excepted . It's fascinating to watch when the turtle is drawing. The result
turns out to be more like an abstract art as time flies.

## Features: 

* Left Click To Start
* Right Click To Pause
* Space To Clear The Canvas
* Escape Button to Exit the program

> Left Clicking again when drawing will make turtle draw a different shape 
on a different place!
