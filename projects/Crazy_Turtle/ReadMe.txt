Crazy Turtle!

	This program was inspired from no. 68 of Turtle Exercises. I
upgraded the program where turtle keep drawing random shapes w/o stopping.
But Included a feature to control it ofc. The Algorithm is perfect enough
to draw irregular and someitmes even regular shapes that we wuldn't have 
excepted . Its fascinating to watch when the turtle is drawing. The result
is turns out to be more like an abstract art as time flies.

Features: 

~ Left Click To Start
~ Right Click To Pause
~ Space To Clear The Canvas
~ Escape Button to Exit the program

	Left Clicking again when drawing will make turtle to draw a different shape 
on a different place!
