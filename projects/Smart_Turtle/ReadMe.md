# Smart Turtle!

## This project was inspired by each of exercises from turtle.
I got an idea like wht if i create something that draw a certain 
shape randomly each time you touch on the screen and right on that screen
where the cursor touches.

## Features : 

* Left Click to draw 
* Right Click to Clear the Canvas 
* Escape Button to Exit the program

## Differences :

> Eventhough These two program V1 and V2 work out the same task, their 
programs are not mostly the same . They have the same concept but 
different approaches. 
I would like to consider on the performane and accuracy of those two
different versions.
